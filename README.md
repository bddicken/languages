# Languages

A repo for collaboratively building small benchmarks to compare languages.
If you have a suggestion for improvement: PR!
If you want to add a language: PR!

## Running

To run one of the benchmarks:

1. `cd` into desired benchmark directory (EG `$ cd loops`)
2. Compile by running `$ bash ../compile.sh`
3. Run via `$ bash ../run.sh`.
  You should see output something like:
  
  ```
  $ bash ../run.sh
  C = 0.77
  Go = 2.07
  Node = 0.79
  Bun = 0.83
  Deno = 1.13
  PyPy = 1.61
  Java = 0.64
  $
  ```

4. For good measure, execute `$ bash ../clean.sh` when finished.

## Adding

To add a language:

1. Select the benchmark directory you want to add to (EG `$ cd loops`)
2. Create a new subdirectory for the language (EG `$ mkdir rust`)
3. Implement the code in the appropriately named file (EG: `code.rs`)
4. If the language is compiled, add appropriate command to `../compile.sh` and `../clean.sh`
5. Add appropriate line to `../run.sh`

You are also welcome to add new top-level benchmarks dirs

# Available Benchmarks

## loops

Emphasizes loop, conditional, and basic math performance.  
Note:  The assembly code was built and compiled on Ubuntu.  To get the rest of code loops to work on Ubuntu, you may need to run dos2unix utility on the code files.  Also, the "Dart" code on Ubuntu can run without compiling it like this: "dart run code.dart 40"

## fibonacci

Emphasizes function call overhead and recursion.
