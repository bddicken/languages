# Delphi Fibonacci Implementation

This implementation requires Delphi to compile. Tested with Delphi 2007.

## Performance
On test hardware:
- Original: Not previously implemented
- Current: 871.8ms
- Compared to other languages on same hardware:
  - Kotlin: 19.0ms
  - Java: 138.6ms
  - Node: 1.505s
  - Python: 27.318s

## Compiler Settings Used
- Build Configuration: Release
- Optimization: Enabled
- Stack frames: Enabled
- Range checking: Disabled
- I/O checking: Disabled
- Overflow checking: Disabled

## Implementation Notes
- Uses same recursive algorithm as other implementations
- Optimized using Cardinal (unsigned 32-bit) integers
- Optimized string parsing with Val function
- Windows-only due to Delphi platform limitations
