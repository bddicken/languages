"""
Optimized Levenshtein distance implementation in Python.
Space Complexity: O(min(m,n)) - only uses two arrays instead of full matrix
Time Complexity: O(m*n) with various optimizations for better real-world performance

Optimizations:
1. Memory Usage:
   - Uses array.array('B') for minimal memory footprint (1 byte per element)
   - Only stores two rows instead of full matrix
   - Ensures shorter string is used as str1 to minimize space
   - Uses memoryview for faster string access

2. Performance:
   - Early termination for common cases
   - SIMD-like optimization for character comparisons
   - Efficient string length and character caching
   - Minimized Python object creation
   - Uses bytearray for faster character comparisons

3. Code Quality:
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Type hints for better IDE support
   - Clear variable naming
   - Detailed comments
