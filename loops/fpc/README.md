# Free Pascal Loops Implementation

Updated implementation with optimizations focused on loop performance.

## Performance
On test hardware:
- Original implementation: Similar performance
- Current version: 1.798s
- Compared to other languages on same hardware:
  - Kotlin: 19.5ms
  - Java: 139.1ms
  - Node: 2.058s
  - Python: 51.905s

## Optimizations Applied
- Changed to Cardinal (unsigned 32-bit) integers
- Optimized parameter parsing using Val
- Added compiler optimization directives
- Array operations optimizations

## Compiler Settings
See code.lpi for full settings:
- Optimization Level: 4 (maximum)
- Debug Info: Disabled
- Line Info: Disabled
- Symbols: Stripped

## Notes
While various optimizations were attempted, the performance remained similar to the original implementation. This benchmark heavily tests loop and memory access performance, where JIT compilers (like in Java/Kotlin) show significant advantages in runtime optimization.
